# CLAUDE.md — HNOV Project

## Project Overview

HNOV ("a movement story") is a single-file 2D platformer built with vanilla HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript. The entire game lives in `hnov_5.html` (~1130 lines). No build tools, no frameworks, no dependencies.

The game is a vertical climb — the player spawns on a ground floor and ascends through platforms to reach a goal flag at the top. The core identity is **floaty, moon-gravity movement** with chained abilities (jump, bounce, float, dash, wall-slide).

## Architecture (inside hnov_5.html)

Single `<script>` block, organized in sections marked with `// ───` headers:

1. **CANVAS & CTX** — 1680x945 canvas, 2x world scale (world is 840x472.5 visible)
2. **PALETTE** — color constants object `P`
3. **LEVEL** — platform arrays, enemies, goal, quake constants
4. **PHYSICS CONSTANTS** — gravity, speeds, timers (all named constants at top)
5. **PLAYER** — `makePlayer()` factory, player state object
6. **PARTICLES** — `spawnParticles()` + per-frame array
7. **INPUT** — keydown/keyup with `justPressed`/`justReleased` buffers
8. **CAMERA** — vertical-follow with 0.1 lerp, horizontal locked (level = viewport width)
9. **COLLISION HELPERS** — AABB `resolveX`/`resolveY`
10. **GAME STATE** — title / playing / win / dead
11. **UPDATE** — main game tick: physics, abilities, animation state machine
12. **SPRITE SYSTEM** — PNG frame loader, `SPRITE_DEFS`, `drawHnov()`
13. **BACKGROUND** — 10-frame ping-pong from `animations/background/frames/`
14. **RENDER** — `drawWorld()`, `drawVignette()`, `drawScanlines()`, overlays
15. **LOOP + INIT** — `requestAnimationFrame` loop, `startGame()`

## Locked Layers — Do NOT Change Without Explicit Permission

These systems are tuned and intentional. Do not modify them unless the user specifically asks:

- **Physics constants** (lines ~190–211): gravity, jump force, dash speed, bounce, friction, coyote/buffer frames
- **SPRITE_DEFS frame counts**: bounce=3, dash=2, etc. — extra frames on disk are intentional unused spares
- **Player hitbox** (w:12, h:16) and sprite anchor math in `drawHnov()`
- **Platform layout** (`staticPlats` array) and goal position
- **Camera system** — lerp factor, clamping logic, 2x scale relationship
- **Control mapping** — WASD/arrows, Space, Q/E, R

## Standing Rules

### Before Every Task
- **Read `CLAUDE.md` first.** If the user says "read CLAUDE.md" or starts a new session, re-read this file before doing anything.
- **Read the relevant section(s) of `hnov_5.html`** before making changes. Never edit code you haven't read in this session.

### Code Changes
- All game code goes in `hnov_5.html`. Do not split into separate JS/CSS files unless explicitly asked.
- Preserve the section-header comment style (`// ─── SECTION NAME ───`).
- Do not add comments, docstrings, or type annotations to code you didn't change.
- Do not refactor, "clean up," or reorganize code adjacent to your change.
- Do not add features beyond what was asked.

### Git Commits
- Do not commit unless the user explicitly asks.
- Do not push unless the user explicitly asks.
- Keep commit messages short (1–2 lines) and focused on what changed and why.
- **Always push to gh-pages after every push to main** — the game is served from the gh-pages branch on GitHub Pages, so both branches must stay in sync.

### Verification
- After any gameplay-affecting change, note what the user should test (e.g., "try jumping off the left wall on platform 3").
- If a change touches physics or collision, call out which locked-layer constants were and were not modified.

### Updating This File
- When the user gives a new standing instruction (e.g., "from now on always X"), add it to this file under the appropriate section.
- When project structure changes materially (new files, renamed files, new game systems), update the file structure and architecture sections.

## Background Scrolling Solution

**Problem:** Background did not scroll vertically with the camera (stayed fixed) and its bottom edge did not align with the ground platform (was 80px too low).

**Root Cause:** The formula in `drawBackground()` (lines ~839–840) used weak 0.3 parallax `(cam.y - bgCamRef) * 2 * 0.3`, which was so small that the canvas clamping kept `bgY` at a fixed value. Additionally, the baseline positioned the background bottom at the canvas bottom (945px) instead of at world ground level (GROUND_Y).

**Solution:**
- Changed parallax factor from 0.3 to 1.0 (full scrolling)
- Changed baseline from `(CH - dH)` to `(GROUND_Y - cam.y) * 2 - dH`
- Updated clamping lower bound from `CH - dH` to `(GROUND_Y - bgCamRef) * 2 - dH`

**Formula:** `bgY = (GROUND_Y - cam.y) * 2 - dH`
- As `cam.y` increases (player climbs), `bgY` becomes more negative (background scrolls up)
- Background bottom stays at `(GROUND_Y - cam.y) * 2`, which is the canvas Y position where the ground appears
- Clamping allows natural range based on camera position, preventing over-clamping

**Test:** Climb the platforms and verify the background scrolls smoothly upward and the background bottom edge aligns with where the ground platform visually appears on screen.

## Background Dimensions Fix

**Problem:** Background was stretched into portrait and showed a black U-shaped border. The code used hardcoded 704×1280 portrait dimensions while actual frames are 832×480 landscape.

**Root Cause:**
- Code assumed: vW = 704, vH = 1280 (portrait: 0.55 aspect ratio)
- Actual frames: 832×480 (widescreen: 1.73 aspect ratio)
- Stretch factors: 2.03x horizontal, 6.40x vertical (severe non-uniform distortion)
- Black border: Background bottom positioned at GROUND_Y canvas position (865), leaving 80px gap at canvas bottom (945)

**Solution:**
- Changed vW/vH from 704/1280 to 832/480 (actual frame dimensions)
- Kept 2.4x scale factor: dW = 1996.8, dH = 1152
- Changed bgY anchor from GROUND_Y to LH (level height at 1480)
- Updated clamping to match new display height: `Math.max(CH - dH, Math.min(0, bgY))`

**Formula:** `bgY = (LH - cam.y) * 2 - dH`
- On spawn (cam.y = bgCamRef ≈ 1007.5): bgY = 945 - 1152 = -207, background bottom exactly at canvas bottom
- As player climbs (cam.y decreases): bgY increases toward 0, background scrolls up showing higher areas
- Clamping range: [-207, 0] prevents overshoot

**Result:**
- Correct 1.73:1 aspect ratio preserved (no distortion)
- Background bottom-left aligns with canvas bottom-left on spawn
- Smooth vertical scrolling with camera
- No black borders at any camera position
